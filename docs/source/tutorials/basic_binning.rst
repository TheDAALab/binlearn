Basic Binning Tutorial
======================

This tutorial introduces the fundamental concepts of data binning and shows how to use binlearn for basic binning tasks.

What is Binning?
----------------

Binning (also called discretization) is the process of converting continuous numerical data into discrete bins or categories. This technique is useful for:

* Simplifying complex continuous data
* Reducing the impact of outliers
* Creating categorical features for certain algorithms
* Improving model interpretability
