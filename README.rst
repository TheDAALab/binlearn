# Binning Module

## Overview

The Binning Module provides a comprehensive set of classes and methods for implementing various binning techniques in data analysis. Binning is a crucial preprocessing step in many machine learning and statistical applications, allowing for the transformation of continuous data into discrete categories. This module supports several binning strategies, including equal width, equal frequency, predefined bins, and clustering-based methods.

## Features

- **Base Class**: The `BinningBase` class serves as the foundation for all binning strategies, ensuring a consistent interface and functionality across different implementations.
- **Multiple Binning Strategies**:
  - **Equal Width Binning**: Divides the range of data into equal-sized intervals.
  - **Equal Frequency Binning**: Ensures that each bin contains approximately the same number of data points.
  - **Predefined Binning**: Allows users to specify custom bins based on domain knowledge.
  - **K-Means Clustering Binning**: Utilizes k-means clustering to define bins based on data distribution.
  - **Adaptive Binning**: Adjusts bin boundaries based on observed weights, allowing for dynamic binning based on data characteristics.
- **Transformations**: Each binning class provides methods to transform data into bin indices, retrieve bin boundaries, and obtain representative values for each bin.
- **Parameter Management**: Each binning strategy can return its parameters, facilitating easy configuration and reproducibility.

## Usage

To use the Binning Module, instantiate one of the binning classes and call the `fit` method with your data. After fitting, you can transform your data into bin indices and retrieve various bin-related information.
