    "# üéØ Supervised Binning Methods: Target-Informed Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to a comprehensive exploration of supervised binning methods in the `binlearn` package. These advanced techniques leverage target variable information to create more informative and predictive bins, often leading to significant improvements in model performance.\n",
